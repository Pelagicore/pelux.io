## Guidelines

Don't use lvl1 headings (\# Heading) in pages, since the css expects the page
title to be h1 but styles it with an id and not a h1 class. That causes any
other h1 elements to be smaller than h2 elements. It also makes sense to only
have one main heading on a page, so stick with lvl2 headings and below.

## How to build

This website uses [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build static HTML. Those
are the steps to build it:

    sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev ruby-bundler zlib1g-dev
    git clone <git repo url>
    cd pelux.io
    bundle install
    bundle exec jekyll serve

This will compile the markdown code and start a server at
[http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) which you can then open in your
browser.

If you get errors when building native extensions with bundle, make sure you
have the necessary libraries installed.
