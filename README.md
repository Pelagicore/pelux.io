# pelux.io

Source code repo for the pelux.io website

## How to build

This website uses [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build static HTML. Those are the steps to build it:

    gem install jekyll bundler
    # git clone <path to git> pelux.io
    cd pelux.io
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    
This will compile the markdown code and start a server at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) which you can then open in your browser.
