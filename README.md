# pelux.io

Source code repo for the pelux.io website

## How to build

This website uses [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build static HTML. These are the steps to build the web site locally:
*NB: You'll want to have jekyll and bundler installed on your system first.*

    git clone <git repo url>
    cd pelux.io
    bundle install
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    
This will compile the markdown code and start a server at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) which you can then open in your browser.
