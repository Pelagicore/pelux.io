We've had some new members in our PELUX team, so today I did a brief
introduction to how the Yocto project works and what's good to keep in mind when
using it in a PELUX context. Since the slides are still rather generic, we
thought to share them here enjoy! And please do point out if something is wrong
in them, nobody's perfect.

As usual, the [Yocto reference
manual](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/ref-manual.html) is
the main source for everything in these slides.

Download the [slides](/assets/pdf/slides-yocto-pelux.pdf), they are released
