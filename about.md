## Modular Software Platform

PELUX is based around an extensive set of largely independent software
components for automotive applications. Through the addition of key platform
components enabling dynamic service access control and sandboxing technologies,
it is possible to integrate services into the platform and choose which
interfaces to expose for specific applications. This makes it possible to take
full benefit of open source software and produce dynamic content without having
to modify implementations or create maintenance requirements.

## Change the Way You Work

### Software Factory
Luxoft provides a Software Factory to help you ease through development pains.
The Software Factory (SWF) concept is intended to be used as a structured way
to set up a platform, and is considered a handbook for the work needed to
develop that platform. This concept also invites users to start creating and
populating their own SWFs as new projects arise.
 
The SWF documentation contains processes (both technical and for project
management) and instructions on how to work with PELUX, as well as instructions
on how to create a standalone project based on PELUX. This ensures knowledge is
transparently shared across teams for better collaboration and reduced
development time.

### Dynamic Content
Modern infotainment systems are built on platform firmware with selected
third-party software by leading vendors, augmented with apps delivered through
app stores. PELUX securely decouples firmware from apps and third-party
services deployment through its Containment and Platform Access Manager
components. These technologies limit what each dynamically added piece of
software can access, but also what capabilities it can provide to the rest of
the system. The Qt Application Manager component is responsible for life cycle
management, including interacting with leading app stores and managing security.
It also ensures apps work with the rest of the platform and are integrated
seamlessly, creating a rich and fresh user experience.

### Software Development Tooling
PELUX comes with tooling to support the development of services. The Software
Development Kit (SDK) provides good practices, documentation and tooling on how
to create Linux-based automotive systems. This enables any developer or designer
to achieve their best in their own domain of competence. We also make sure
knowledge is transparently shared with all teams.

### Integrate Continuously
PELUX is designed for a development process built on agile development methods
and continuous integration and delivery strategies. Using technologies such as
Yocto, Git and Jenkins lets you manage complex projects with a high degree of
transparency, providing immediate feedback into your agile development process.

### Vehicle Integration
One of the key challenges of bringing consumer-grade technology to automotive
applications is efficiently integrating it into electrical architectures. With
expert knowledge from automotive-specific networking and diagnostics
technologies, PELUX can be configured to support an automotive network such as
Ethernet AVB and provide support for Adaptive AUTOSAR&reg;. Luxoft Automotive
provides MLB connectivity and also launched the Open Source GENIVI&reg; EAVB
Reference Implementation project.

and deploying your product to the market, Luxoft Automotive provides a key mix
of top industry experts and Open Source Linux engineers that will get the job
done. Our competence ranges from pixel to silicon, enabling us to support your
projects with a holistic view on how to design and deliver the end product. With
