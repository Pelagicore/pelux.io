## Long term goal

The long term goal of PELUX is to provide the leading developer experience for
device creation, tuned to automotive needs.

This includes the creation of end user applications, new platform functions or target
image creation. PELUX improves the developer experience by providing ready made
target images, integrated software development environments, open CI/CD blueprints, as
well as extensive documentation.

in January 2018. For already released versions, see the [downloads](/downloads)
