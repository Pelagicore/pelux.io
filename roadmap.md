## Long term goal

The long-term goal of PELUX is to provide the leading developer experience in
device creation, tuned to automotive needs.

This includes the creation of end-user applications, new platform functions or target
image creation. PELUX improves the developer experience by providing ready-made
target images, integrated software development environments, open CI/CD blueprints, as
well as extensive documentation.

## Milestones

The PELUX project aims to provide biannual releases. The first release was done
in January 2018. For already released versions, see the [Releases](/releases)
page.
