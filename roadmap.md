## Long term goal

The long-term goal of PELUX is to provide the leading developer experience in
device creation, tuned to automotive needs.

This includes the creation of end-user applications, new platform functions or target
image creation. PELUX improves the developer experience by providing ready-made
target images, integrated software development environments, open CI/CD blueprints, as
well as extensive documentation.

## Milestones

The PELUX project aims to provide biannual releases. The first release was done
in January 2018. For already released versions, see the [downloads](/downloads)

### PELUX 2.0 [July 2018]
Content of this release is under discussion. Tentatively the topics in focus will be:
- Intel ARP board support
- Qt 5.10
- SOTA updates
