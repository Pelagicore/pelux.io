## Long term goal

The long term goal of PELUX is to provide the leading developer experience for device creation, tuned to automotive needs.

This includes the creation of end user apps, new platform functions or target image creation. PELUX improves the developer experience by providing ready made target images, integrated software development kits, open CI/CD blueprint as well as extensive documentation.

## Milestones

The PELUX project targets milestone releases twice per year. Our first target is October 2017.

The exact contents of the October 2017 release is still TBD.
